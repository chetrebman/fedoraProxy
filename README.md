FedoraProxy - November 14 2012

fedoraProxy acts as a proxy to a Fedora Commons digital repository and a SOLR index

fedoraProxy provides remote ingesting capability for the fedoraApp web application, however it has many standalone functions.

fedoraProxy is written using Java, Spring and GWT technologies.

The distribution is a complete Eclipse project.

All source is in the src directory.

FedoraApp and fedoraProxy has been used extensively by The Colorado Alliance of Research Libraries and is reliable. However being a single person rather then a software department, I haven't had
the to time to extensively document the big picture, so I choose to create a working example instead.
Therefore even if you intend to run fedoraProxy stand-alone, it is recommended you look at the github download that contains
jetty along with both fedoraApp and fedoraProxy and look at the sample batch files and tutorial.
